Pamela Hartzband and Jerome Groopman wrote a perspective article for the NEJM titled Medical Taylorism[^1] in which they describe how  Taylorism, a framework pioneered by [Frederick Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Winslow_Taylor), has affected the practice of medicine and medical education.

Frederick Taylor was an engineer who became interested in efficiency, its standardization, and its application in various aspects of daily life. In 1911 he wrote a book titled [The Principles of Scientific Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Principles_of_Scientific_Management) in which he published his findings and implementation of  this framework, also knwon as [Taylorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_management). This framework was popular in the manufacturing industry of the early 20th century and continues to influence many fields to this day, including the corporate world. This framework is known for removing the cognitive processes necessary to perform the work, breaking down behavioral tasks to their atomic component, and measuring how long it takes to complete each task.[^2]

As per Hartzband and Groopman Taylorism does not apply to all of aspects of medicine as "patients are genetically, physiologically, psychologically, and culturally diverse." Furthermore, "cognitive tasks as eliciting an accurate history, synthesizing clinical and laboratory data to make a diagnosis, and weighing the risks and benefits of a given treatment for an individual patient. Good thinking takes time, and the time pressure of Taylorism creates a fertile field for the sorts of cognitive errors that result in medical mistakes. Moreover, rushed clinicians are likely to take actions that ignore patients’ preferences."

They also report the impact Taylorism has had on medical education when students are taught that "there must be one best way to diagnose and treat every medical condition." This is incompatible to practices where physicians "modify and individualize care in the real world, recognizing the variety of clinical presentations, the reality of multiple coexisting conditions, the variability of human biology, the effects of social and cultural contexts, and the diversity of patients’ preferences regarding risk and benefit, all of which defy rigid protocols."

[Brian Hodges](http://www.psychiatry.utoronto.ca/people/dr-brian-d-hodges/) states that Taylorism in medical education has become influential and part of a production discourse with "language and concepts borrowed from manufacturing industry" which "can lead to new forms of incompetence."[^3] Hodges adds that standardi zation in Taylorism "has even greater prominence [than psychometrics]; education is construed as a manufacturing process and students as raw material first, and then product." The main emphasis in this framework, as per Hodges, is on "outcomes and surveillance."

The science behind Taylorism is questionable at best and its practices led Frederick Taylor to appear before a congressional hearing.[^4] I believe Taylorism, or its other derivatives, do not provide a developmental framework for exeprtise development or expert practice. In my opinion, this is a framework that leads to what [Daniel Dennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett) calls competence without comprehension, well depicted by Michael Gazzaniga:

>Competence is the ability to carry out an act, but comprehension implies that the organism (or robot) carrying out the act has intent and an understanding of what it is doing. As I like to say, you may have a theory about your dog, but your dog doesn't have any kind of theory about you.[^5]
