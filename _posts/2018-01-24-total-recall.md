Wikipedia defines memory as "the faculty of the mind by which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved."[^1] This process, far from perfect, can store and retrieve information implicitly, explicitly, short-term, and long-term. Not only is this process imperfect, but the model itself can easily be misunderstood and misused.

When [Herman Ebbinghaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus) performed experiements on learning and forgetting he used [nonsensical syllables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve), and although a this is a great model for studyinig memory, this is not an exact model of how memory works in settings where meaningful information is frequently retrieved and encoded.<br>

After a piece of information gets learned and gets retrieved less frequently and time moves forward its access decreases. This information is not forgotten as it is commonly believed, but it becomes less accessible. An explanation might be that the brain "sees" no use in accessing this information which may be irrelevant in that particular setting and gives priority to more relevant information. It is also important to consider the accuracy of our memories since retrieval is not an exact process and our memories are reconstructed each time we recall pieces of information. There is also the case where performance can fool us, that is, when information has high retrieval strength and low storage strength. This may happen in settings where performance is increased and there is little to no [desirable difficulties](https://bjorklab.psych.ucla.edu/research/). The problem with retrieval of information with high retrieval strength and high storage strength is that it takes away time and effort from practicing relevant information that has become less accessible and encoding new relevant information. For more on the relationship between information, time, retrieval strength, and storage strength see Bjorks' [The New Theory of Disuse](https://bjorklab.psych.ucla.edu/research/).

One of the most interesting [misconceptions](http://www.jvrbntz.com/2017/09/inside-storehouse-of-memories.html) about memory is that it stores words, pictures, and sounds. Daniel Dennett states:

>The idea that memory is a storehouse of things written is already a metaphor, and even a bad metaphor. The very idea that there has to be a language of thought doesn't make sense unless you think of it as a written language of thought. A spoken language of thought won't get you much of anything. One of the themes that interests me is the idea of talking before you know you're talking, before you know what talking is, which we all do. Children do it. There's a big difference between talking and self-conscious talking, which, if you get clear about it, helps with the theory of language.[^2]

This of course, is in major contrast to an approach of memorizing textbooks, review books, and lecture notes as if they were sacred texts disseminated by high priests. This is not how the mind works.[^3] There are also different kinds of problems with an approach of encoding and retrieval of information indiscriminately. Retrieving and encoding irrelevant information is not just a waste of time, but it can also [interfere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_theory) with the retrieval and encoding of important relevant information. If this model is considered to be useful in understanding how the mind works it is also important to take into account the context in which the interaction is taken place. This model does not view the mind just as a repository of [categorizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization), but as an active participant in our cultural evolution.[^4] In this model the brain is an [information processing organ that generates the mind](http://www.jvrbntz.com/2017/09/tool-for-processing-signal-to-noise.html) as the CPU generates the desktop screen. Unlike the CPU, the [brain](http://www.jvrbntz.com/2017/10/memex-for-our-cognitive-limitations.html) does not encode and retrieve information as accurately and/or efficiently as the desktop computer, but it still [computes information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_theory_of_mind).

Not only does the mind does not work as a CPU, but the approach towards scientific knowledge differs quite significantly from that of a religious attitude. Unlike a religious attitude, a scientific attitude reminds us about our own fallibility and the uncertainty and fallibility of knowledge itself. As per Djulbegovic et al. science "evolved as the primary means to address and reduce uncertainty. An essential distinction from religion is that scientific and medical knowledge is admittedly fallible."[^5] Some might even equate scientific knowledge with word associations, as in a crossword puzzle, and much of education is approached in this manner, but again this is not how science works.[^6] Even the scientific article is just a representation of how an experiment or a study was performed. Reading scientific articles still requires a lot to be inferred, not just from the article, but from an understanding of how science works and the domain itself.[^7] 


I think memorization is important, but there may be plenty of misunderstanding and misuse of this process. I also think the use of computer softwares, such as [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) (no conflict of interest), are useful tools to learn about our own effectiveness, accuracy, and efficiency of memory retrieval on a regular basis. But this conceptualization needs to take into account our cognitive limitations, the context and relevance in which encoding and retrieval is taken place, and the uncertainty and fallibility of [scientific knowledge](http://www.jvrbntz.com/2017/11/change-we-can-believe-in.html). Furthermore, if we are to reflect about our own learning education needs to acknowledge our [human limitations](http://www.jvrbntz.com/2017/11/what-is-purpose-of-education.html) and provide us with helpful tools to improve our own learning.<br>
