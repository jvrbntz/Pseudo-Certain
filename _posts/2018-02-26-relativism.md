Mental processes are some of the most challenging topics to talk about, like learning, these unobservable events must be inferred from observable behavior. Although some people might acknowledge that mental processes do occur they abstain from theorizing about these unobservable phenomena. Cognitive scientists, on the other hand, have provided a scientific language and methodologies to help explore these events since the [cognitive revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_revolution) which happened in the 1950’s. One of the major contributions from this revolution, thanks to [cognitive science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science), [philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/), and others, is the approach of the brain as an [information processing organ/system](http://www.jvrbntz.com/2017/09/tool-for-processing-signal-to-noise.html) which gives rise to the mind. According to [Steven Pinker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pinker),
>The mind is what the brain does; specifically, the brain processes information, and thinking is a kind of computation.

According to cognitive scientists these unobservable [mental processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_process), which include memory storage, memory retrieval,  reasoning, judgment, and more are essential in decision making and problem solving. These mental processes are in the mind, which also happens to be an unobservable phenomena. What the mind is, what it does, and how it does what it does continue to be [debated](https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer) to this day.  This presents many challenges when trying to describe, teach, learn, measure, and test for these mental processes, but it hasn't stopped scientific progress from occurring. 

Recently, a group of researchers gathered to define clinical reasoning, but found many discrepancies within the literature and also when comparing each other's understanding of the subject.[^1] After reading the manuscript I am left to think that medical education research has no scientific explanation for clinical reasoning. Furthermore, according to the group,

>Clinical reasoning research represents a diverse and historically fragmented literature; it is not surprising, then, that this literature may represent multiple notions of what clinical reasoning “is”—specifically the co-existence of multiple definitions and multiple possible limits to be placed around component processes and contributing factors. This co-existence of multiple parallel definitions or conceptualizations has been documented in other domains in HPE such as “professionalism,” “validity,” and “competence” — and so is not limited to the construct of clinical reasoning.  

and,

>It is unlikely that a unified definition of clinical reasoning is achievable, nor even desirable; rather, the open acknowledgment of the boundaries under which our theories, teaching interventions, or assessments are designed to operate could facilitate better communication amongst those working in clinical reasoning in order to build a more comprehensive understanding of clinical reasoning and its component processes.

This does not represent the current state of cognitive science and what cognitive scientists set out to do when they started to explore mental processes under scientific investigation. This, also, does not align with investigations in clinical reasoning by some medical education researchers and educators of past and present.    

Also from the article, 
>Based on this reflective exercise, it is unlikely that clinical teachers all share the same conceptualization of clinical reasoning, and also unlikely that students and teachers share the same understanding when discussing the concept of clinical reasoning. This may lead to difficulty when educational teams design curricula, work towards consensus definitions of competencies, or describing educational outcomes. It is also possible that different notions of what is a “relevant” contributor to clinical reasoning would result in different tasks seen as useful or necessary for teaching learners the “right” version of “good” clinical reasoning.

I give a lot of credit to the group in exploring the literature and expressing their understanding of clinical reasoning. But this brings many questions about medical education and its research program. How, then, can medical education claim to be able to teach and measure what it claims to teach and measure when it looks like an environment where anything goes? The current state is more like the heavily criticized stance of [Postmodernism and Relativism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativism) than the scientific endeavor set out by cognitive scientists and others long time ago.
