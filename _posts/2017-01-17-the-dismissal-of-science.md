In a recent article for theguardian Tegan Bennett Daylight writes:

> Spoon-fed, I hear you say? Don’t make me laugh. This is a feast of force-feeding, a Roman orgy of information and assistance, with students helpless and lolling while academics assist them in opening their mouths so the food can be tipped in, and then hold their jaws and help them masticate until it goes down. We keep asking ourselves why this generation are so anxious. They are anxious because nobody lets them do things alone: we intervene before they have had a chance to try, let alone succeed or fail. They never get to feel the limits, or the limitlessness, of their real selves.[^1]

Spoon-fed education has been identified in medical education as well. In 1990 Howard Barrows wrote:

 > Case histories and case vignettes containing succinct and complete databases are used extensively in the teaching and evaluation of medical students. The clinicians who wrote these cases had to generate appropriate initial hypotheses about the patient’s problem, as it initially presented, and carry out an appropriate inquiry to assemble the significant and relevant data for the case write-up. As a result, this important and often difficult aspect of reasoning has already been performed for the student. For undergraduate students who must learn to inquire logically in an effective and efficient manner, this use of case vignettes or complete cases may be worse than spoon-feeding. A teacher at the Harvard Business School, where the ‘case method’ has flourished over the last half century, identified the same problem with their use of cases. He expressed the concern that when their students entered the real business world after graduation no one would give them a case when they were confronted by a problem and they would not know how to obtain the data they needed to build their own case.

Spoon-feeding creates an educational environement without [desirable difficulty](http://www.jvrbntz.com/2017/10/practice-practice-practice.html) that also features an [illusion](http://www.jvrbntz.com/2017/06/learning-understanding-and-illusion-of.html) of [understanding](http://www.jvrbntz.com/2017/09/the-internet-and-illusion-of-explanation.html). We need to ask [what is education for](http://www.jvrbntz.com/2017/06/education-for-tools.html) and if it's not to help us with our limitations of [experience](http://www.jvrbntz.com/2017/08/miscalibrated-and-overconfident.html) and [cognition](http://www.jvrbntz.com/2017/11/what-is-purpose-of-education.html) we should also be asking who benefits from our miseducation.

History teaches us that learning how science works provides a better understanding how the world works and it also teaches us how we can benefit the most despite our limitations. Unfortunately, this is a lesson that keeps being ignored in major aspects of our lives, including education. This is type of education does not acknowledge our limitations and keeps spoon-feeding isolated facts without teaching the process of how these facts come about.  Science and democracy are complimentary to each other as both teach us to debate and search for truth in a systematic fashion.[^3]

This way of thinking and criticism of ideas has major implications in all aspects of our daily lives.[^4] Here is Stephen Pinker take on dismissing science and Academia:
