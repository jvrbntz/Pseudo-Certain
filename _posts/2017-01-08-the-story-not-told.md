In his 2011 book Daniel Kahneman wrote:

> The mind&mdash;especially System 1&mdash;appears to have a special aptitude for the construction and interpretation of stories about active agents, who have personalities, habits, and abilities.[^1]

Although storytelling continues to play a major role in cultural and social aspects of our daily living[^2], it has also been part of practices that slow human progress and cause of major human suffering. Storytelling is a persuasive tool that appeals to our intuition and it has been proposed that stories "infect" our minds and get transmitted from person to person and passed down through generations in a similar manner as genes are passed down.[^3] Proponents of the meme theory state that stories are contextual, get modified, compete with one another and their adaptations can be explained using Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling)'s entry on storytelling states:

> Storytelling describes the social and cultural activity of sharing stories, sometimes with improvisation, theatrics, or embellishment. Every culture has its own stories or narratives, which are shared as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation or instilling moral values. Crucial elements of stories and storytelling include plot, characters and narrative point of view.

The cognitive effort necessary to seek and understand scientific explanations is no match to the appeal to intuition and emotional persuasion employed by storytellers. This is the story we are not told. We are not told about all the hurdles science has gone through for the benefit of human progress. Thomas Kuhn wrote about how this non-linear progression, full of failures and prosecutions, is not well portrayed in textbooks and schools.[^4] The way we are told about how science works and its history these days is very much [just-so story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-so_story) in itself. The best antidote to this is to teach the history of science and science's critical method as Carl Sagan suggested.
