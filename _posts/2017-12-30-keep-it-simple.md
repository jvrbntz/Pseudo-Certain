In keeping with the original Hyde theme, Hydeout aims to keep the overall design lightweight and plugin-free. JavaScript is currently limited only to Disqus and Google Analytics (and is only loaded if you provide configuration variables).

Hydeout makes heavy use of Flexbox in its CSS. If Flexbox is not available, the CSS degrades into a single column layout.
